This file contains sequences, that are static.
A "sequence" is a pre-defined set of moves that can be used, if combined to create a profile.

A sequence can be, for instance, what buttons need to be pressed to enter the controls menu.
For sequences that are dynamic, check the file: utils/generators.py
